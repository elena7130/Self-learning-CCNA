## Goal

1. Configure the floating static route as the backup
    (OSPF route to be used by default)

 ## Configuration - check route tables** (on the R1 and R2)
 
 
```
 R1(config) do show ip route 
```

## Configuration - configure the floating static route as the OSPF backup route (on the R1 and R2)
 
```
 R1(config) ip route [destination IP mask next-hop] [AD]
 
 # [AD]>110,because OSPF's administrative distance is 110 , so if we want to use OSPF route by default , we should configure the floating route's AD ,which is > OSPF'S AD 111  
```

## Tips:
We should notice the AD. If we don't add AD after 'ip route ', the defalt route would change to static route rather than OSPF
