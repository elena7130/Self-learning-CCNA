### What is the Etherchannel and What are the problems that Etherchannel solved ?

- As the more hosts connect to access layer switch and more bandwidths from accessble switch to the distribution layer switch
the multiple links between access switch and distribution layer might cause broadcast storms , so we need a method to make 
the multiple interfaces together to act a single interface , so this method means Etherchannel . At the same time , STP will 
treat the group to as a single interface .
